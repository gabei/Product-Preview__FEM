## My process

### Built with
- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- Javascript DOM Manipulation 


### What I learned
I learned how to use the `<picture>` element to supply various image sources for an `<img>` tag. I also learned a bit about triggering CSS animations.

### Continued development
I'm excited about implementing more CSS animations in future projects. I think they are the icing on the user experience cake, and really do a lot to emphasize the actions that the user is taking in real time.
